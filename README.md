# Sliding Log Rate Limiter with Go and Redis

This repository implements a **Sliding Log Rate Limiter** using Go and Redis. The sliding log algorithm ensures precise rate limiting by maintaining a log of request timestamps and supports distributed systems with atomic operations using Redis Lua scripting.

## Features

- **Accurate Sliding Log Algorithm**: Dynamically calculates the rate limit window for precise control.
- **Distributed Support**: Shared rate limits across multiple application instances.
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses Lua scripting in Redis to ensure thread-safe operations.
- **Configurable**: Easily adjust rate limits and time windows via environment variables or configuration.

## How It Works

1. Each API request logs its timestamp in a Redis sorted set.
2. The Lua script:
    - Removes outdated timestamps outside the rate limit window.
    - Counts valid timestamps within the window.
    - Adds the new timestamp if the request is allowed.
3. The result determines whether the request can proceed or should be throttled.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.18+**
- **Redis 6.0+**

## Benchmarking

Benchmark the rate limiter to test its throughput:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

Sample results (local setup):
- Avg operation time: **55.37 Î¼s**
- Throughput: **~18,000 requests/sec**
